#Quick Punk Song Generator

This repo is dedicated to a short algorithm for making hardcore punk riffs on the fly. In fact, it's just a single Ruby method at this time. It's short and to the point, just like the songs it will generate. 

As a kid, my entire understanding of music theory was limited to the numerical relationships between frets on a bass guitar. This very crude understanding of the fret board would later become crucial when I taught myself the guitar and piano.

I am turning back to my early youth and simplistic understanding of the fretboard in order to write a hardcore punk EP. The algorithm will generate random numbers from 0 to 12. Those numbers will be the frets played on a particular open bass string also selected by the algorithm. The 5 harshest sounding songs will be recorded for all to hear.

This short algorithm marks the beginning of a personal exploration of writing music through computer programs. Over the next few years, I hope to develop something much more complex beyond something that generates mosh pit material.
