#Quick Punk Song Generator

This repo is dedicated to a short algorithm for making hardcore punk riffs on the fly.

When I first started teaching myself bass as a kid, I could only understand the relationship of the frets to each other in terms of numerical relationships (the fifth fret on a string was the same note as the open string below it, seventh fret an octave higher than the open string above it, etc.). This very crude understanding of the fret board would become crucial to me later when I taught myself the guitar and piano.

I am turning back to my early youth and simplistic understanding of the fret board in order to write a hardcore punk EP. The algorithm will generate random numbers from 0 to 12. Those numbers will be the frets played on a particular open string also selected by the alogorithm. The 5 harshest sounding songs will be recorded for all to hear.
